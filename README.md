## Chrome Extension

### Page Turner
Detects in page pagination and notifies you via an icon.  
Allows you to use the left/right arrow keys on a keyboard to go back/next.  
Now prerenders next links for super fast page loads! See more: https://developers.google.com/chrome/whitepapers/prerender

Created from my wish that any website with a back or next link could be controlled from my keyboard's arrow keys.

## TODO
1. Change text-based arrows to images (like Last.fm use: http://www.last.fm/music/NOFX/+images/7661861)  
2. Improve promotional image:
 - Separate options onto secondary image
 - Actually show pagination in browser screenshot so it's clearer
 - Page arrows (if set) load when DOM fully loaded. On pages like IMDB's image gallery these appear after a considerable delay
