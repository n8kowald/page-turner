## Chrome Extension

### Page Turner
Detects in page pagination and notifies you via an icon.  
Allows you to use the left/right arrow keys on a keyboard to go back/next.  

Created from my wish that any website with a back or next link could be controlled from my keyboard's arrow keys.

### Install
https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/page-turner/fpbddhncmmhkaofhcnkjgcdbgcmomebo

## TODO
1. Improve promotional image:
 - Separate options onto secondary image  
2. Google search results - when you enter a new query it needs to invalidate the initially captured back/next links
