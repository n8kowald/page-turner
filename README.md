## Chrome Extensions

### Keyboard Shortcut Sniffer
Detects keyboard shortcuts in a website and if found displays them.

### Google Plus Tweaker
Modifies CSS so the Circles navbar always remains at the top of the page.
I find myself wanting to switch to say 'Friends' after scrolling my 'All' view.
This makes it easier.
