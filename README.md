## Chrome Extension

### Page Turner
Detects in page pagination and notifies you via an icon.  
Allows you to use the left/right arrow keys on a keyboard to go back/next.  

Created from my wish that any website with a back or next link could be controlled from my keyboard's arrow keys.

### Install

## TODO
1. Improve promotional image:
 - Separate options onto secondary image  
2.  Page arrows (if set) load when DOM fully loaded. On pages like IMDB's image gallery these appear after a considerable delay
